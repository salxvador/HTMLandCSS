####Space Station Site
This is a website for a space travel company. It was one of my first projects in HTML, and is styled with CSS. It contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

####Cinema Site
I created this mock-cinema site that I styled using the Bootstrap framework. It contains a jumbotron, navbar, cards, and more.
